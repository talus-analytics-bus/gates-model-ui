PSEUDOCODE for seasonality
Assume at least one complete season will be simulated
Need list of season start dates and end dates
is_malaria_season --> list of length N_DAYS (this includes burn)
compute season-start-date and season-end-date as usual for intial values
		
if sim_start_date is during the season:
	Set first season start date to be equal to [x] months before the sim start date where [x] is the number of months to the first month of the season
	Set the burn in start date to be equal to N_DAYS_BURN days before that date
	Find next season end date, add to end date list (as usual)
else:
	Set first season start date to be whatever user input
	Set first season end date to be appropriate end date
	
list_create while loop start:
	If next season start date is less than sim end date: (calculate as right number of months after cur end date)
		add it to the list
		update cur start date
	else:
		break while loop
	If next season end date is less than sim end date:
		add it to the list
		update cur end date
	else:
		set "fake" season end date to be equal to sim end date
		break while loop
				
Make sure start and end date lists are the same length
boolean_flags for loop start:
	for each start date:
		set cur start date
		set cur end date
		take diff between these dates and burn in start to get indices of season vector that should be set to true
		
		
Burn in period:
	4 months of non-seasonal
	If sim starts during season:
		Burn for more time, equal to however long the model would've been in season (ex: if starting 2 months into a 5-month season, burn for additional 3 months with seasonality turned on)
		End burn there
	Else:
		End burn there
